This file uses spectral clustering on an input dataset. First, the algorithm reads from a list of blogs as well as connections between blogs to create a picture of a netwok. Next, the bogs are clustered. The Adjancy matric is transformed into the Laplacian matrix, and eigen-decomposition is preformed. K-Means is then preformed to group the data into k clusters. After this, the mismatch rate is calculated, and a simulation is run to find metrics for a variety of cluster values.
